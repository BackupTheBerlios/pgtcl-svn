# Tcl package index file
#
# This is a modified package index file for Pgtcl on Windows. Pgtcl needs
# libpq, but libpq has to be found on PATH. So this modifies PATH before
# loading libpgtcl. This allows you to store both pgtclXX.dll and
# libpq.dll (and other PostgreSQL related dlls) in the package directory.
